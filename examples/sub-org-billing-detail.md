# Sub-org Billing Detail

This tutorial walks you through accessing the steps required to access detailed billing data across sub-organization accounts using a specified date and time range.

## Objectives

Understand how to use multiple API services and methods to access detailed billing data for all sub organization accounts for a specified time and date range.

## Services used

This tutorial uses the following technologies:
* [SoftLayer Python Library](http://softlayer-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Account Service](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account)
* [Billing_Invoice Service](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice/)
* [Billing_Invoice_Item Service](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice_Item/)
* [Billing_item Service](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Item/)

## Architecture

Accounts (refered to in this document as a sub account) can be owned by a Brand Account, which is the top level
account type for an organization which can enable sub-organizational level billing.  The API Key for a Brand Account
has access billing data for it's sub accounts. This tutorial demonstrates how to leverage Account, Invoice and Billing 
API's to identify invoices accross the multiple sub accounts owned by an organization for a specific range of
dates.  For each invoice, a list of top level billing items are  retreived, such as the billing data for a single
virtual machine.   These top level items, often have detailed sub-billing items such as memory, disk, or cpu which
are also retreived.  

## Install SoftLayer Python Library
* [SoftLayer API Python Client Installation](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/blob/master/README.rst)


## Obtain a list of invoices for all owned Sub Accounts

Using the [getObject](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account/getObject) method of 
the [Account](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account) class and a nested account mask you can return a list of invoices for all brands owned accounts.

```
ownedBrands = client['Account'].getObject(mask="ownedBrands.allOwnedAccounts.invoices")
```

There are several types of invoices which will be returned, for this example the typical invoice type that would be of interest
 is the "RECURRING" type, which includes all the monthly recurring and hourly usage charges incurred on that invoice.

Invoice Types:
* "NEW" typeCode signifies an invoice for new service. 
* "RECURRING" invoices are generated on an accounts anniversary billing date for monthly services.
* "ONE-TIME-CHARGE" invoices are generated when one-time charges are applied to an account.
* "CREDIT" invoices are generated whenever IBM applies a credit against an account's balance. 

The list of invoices should then be filtered to include just the specific type of invoices and dates ranges to be
evaluated.

```
ownedBrands = client['Account'].getObject(mask="ownedBrands.allOwnedAccounts.invoices")

startDate =  "2018-04-01T00:00:00-06:00"
endDate =  "2018-05-01T11:59:59-06:00"

invoiceType = "RECURRING"
invoiceList=[]

for brand in ownedBrands['ownedBrands']:
    for account in brand['allOwnedAccounts']:
        for invoice in account['invoices']:
            invoiceCreateDate = invoice['createDate']
            if (invoice['typeCode'] == invoiceType) \
                    and (dateutil.parser.parse(invoiceCreateDate) > dateutil.parser.parse(startDate)
                         and dateutil.parser.parse(invoiceCreateDate) < dateutil.parser.parse(endDate)):
                invoiceInfo = client['Billing_Invoice'].getObject(id=invoice['id'],
                    mask="id,createDate,typeCode,invoiceTotalAmount,invoiceTotalRecurringAmount,invoiceTopLevelItemCount")
                invoiceList.append(invoiceInfo)

print (invoiceList)
```

## Access invoice detail
Using the list of invoices returned, use the [getInvoiceTopLevelItems](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice/getInvoiceTopLevelItems/)
method from the [Billing_Invoice](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice) class to obtain the list of top level items being billed on the invoice specified.

```
for invoice in InvoiceList:
    topLevelItems = client['Billing_Invoice'].getInvoiceTopLevelItems(id=invoice['id'])    
    print (topLevelItems)
```

## Access sub item details

If additional billing detail is desired for topLevelItems, many items have associated children which have billing details
that make up to the top level item such as memory, storage, or disk.   To access, the details use  [getNonZeroAssociatedChildren](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice_Item/getNonZeroAssociatedChildren) method in the [Billing_Invoice_Item](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice_Item)
class, by passing the id received from the getInvoiceTopLevelItems call.  The method only returns those associated children with a non-zero cost.

```
nonZeroAssociatedChildren = client['Billing_Invoice_Item'].getNonZeroAssociatedChildren(id=topLevelItemId)
```
## Sample script

The following sample script creates a .csv file of all the billing level detail for each owned sub account for the dates specified.

```
import SoftLayer, argparse, csv,logging,time
from datetime import datetime
import dateutil.parser

def getDescription(categoryCode, detail):
    for item in detail:
        if 'categoryCode' in item:
            if item['categoryCode']==categoryCode:
                return item['description']
    return "Not Found"

client = SoftLayer.Client()

startDate = '2018-07-01T00:00:00'
endDate = '2018-07-31T23:59:59'
outputname = 'billing-export.csv'


## OPEN CSV FILE FOR OUTPUT
outfile = open(outputname, 'w')
csvwriter = csv.writer(outfile, delimiter='\t', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)

fieldnames = ['Invoice_Date', 'Account_Id', 'Invoice_Number', 'BillingItemId', 'InstanceType', 'hostName', 'Category', 'Description',
             'Hours', 'Hourly_Rate', 'RecurringCharge', 'InvoiceTotal', 'InvoiceRecurring', 'Type']
csvwriter = csv.DictWriter(outfile, delimiter=',', fieldnames=fieldnames)
csvwriter.writerow(dict((fn, fn) for fn in fieldnames))


#

#
print("Looking up invoices for brand....")
ownedBrands = client['Account'].getObject(mask="ownedBrands.allOwnedAccounts.invoices")

# FILTER INVOICES FOR INVOICETYPE AND DATE RANGE REQUESTED

invoiceType = "RECURRING"
invoiceList=[]

    for account in brand['allOwnedAccounts']:
        for invoice in account['invoices']:
            invoiceCreateDate = invoice['createDate']

                    and (dateutil.parser.parse(invoiceCreateDate) > dateutil.parser.parse(startDate)
                         and dateutil.parser.parse(invoiceCreateDate) < dateutil.parser.parse(endDate)):
                invoiceInfo = client['Billing_Invoice'].getObject(id=invoice['id'],
